# rusty dice

This is a simple project with two goals:

- simulate dice rolls well enough for other personal projects, like a command-line
  dice roller or a Discord bot.

- provide me with an excuse to practice with Rust

In all likelihood, new features will only be added if and when I need
them for personal projects. Most future contributions are likely to be
tests, as those are a bit sparse right now and testing code that's
meant to be nondeterministic will be a good exercise for me.
